# FIFA21 Clustering Analysisâš½
Explore Unsupervised techniques to cluster FIFA21 players together.

1. Choose between clustering techniques

2. Select Number of Clusters

3. Set players' overall range

4. Observe which players are "more similar" than the rest

# Project Inspirations
- First and foremost, it's for me to experience with all the unsupervised clustering algorithms, as most of the times I have been working on supervised algorithms. 

- Secondly, as a FIFA player myself, most of the times I realised we will try to look for "alternatives" for our team players. Or, when we are trying to purchase players during transfer windows, we always try to look for similar alternatives that are better bargains. 

# Data
Data was extracted from [Kaggle]("https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset"). Data available includes FIFA15 all the way to FIFA21. In this project, analysis was conducted on FIFA21 players only.

# Python Packages
pandas, numpy, streamlit, scikit_learn, plotly
